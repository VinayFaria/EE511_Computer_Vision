a) Transform the given image (image_1) using rotation, affine and homography transforms.
You can test with different parameters in each case. 

b) Estimate the homography / affine transform using examples created in the first part.

c) Image mosaicing (mosaic.zip)

For part b) and c)  you will have to manually select corresponding points in the reference image and the transformed image for computing motion parameters.

For c), mosaic the given 5 images (mosaic.zip) and compare with the reference image.
